Project: Investigate a Dataset

In this project, choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

The data set selected was the no-show appointment data set. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. The patients may or may not show up for their scheduled appointments due to some various reasons. An investigation of the data set was carried out to see if any of the patients' detials, given as variables, have any effect to whether or not they show up to their appointments.
