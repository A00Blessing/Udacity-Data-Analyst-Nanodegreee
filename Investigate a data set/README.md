**Project: Investigate a Dataset**

In this project, choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

+ **Step One - Choose Your Data Set**
Open a document with links and information about data sets that you can investigate for this project. You must choose one of these datasets to complete the project.

+ **Step Two - Get Organized**
We recommend creating a single folder that will eventually contain:
1. The report communicating your findings
2. Any Python code you wrote as part of your analysis
3. The data set you used.

+ **Step Three - Analyze Your Data**
Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions. 

+ **Step Four - Share Your Findings**
Create a report that shares the findings you found most interesting. If you use a Jupyter notebook, share your findings alongside the code you used to perform the analysis.
