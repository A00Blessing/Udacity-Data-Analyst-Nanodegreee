**Project: Explore US bikeshare**

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

+ 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
+ 2 Popular stations and trip
+ 3 Trip duration
+ 4 User info
