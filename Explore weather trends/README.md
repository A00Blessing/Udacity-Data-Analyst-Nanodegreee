**Project: Explore weather trends**

In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends. Your goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live. To do this, you’ll follow the steps below:

1.Extract the data from the database.

2.Open up the CSV in whatever tool using Excel or Google sheets.

3. Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures.

4. Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
