Step 1: Gathering Data
In this step, you will gather all three pieces of data as described below in the "Data Gathering" section in the wrangle_act.ipynb notebook.

Step 2: Assessing Data
After gathering all three pieces of data, assess them visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues. Detect and document at least eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues in the "Accessing Data" section in the wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

Step 3: Cleaning Data
Clean all of the issues you documented while assessing. Perform this cleaning in the "Cleaning Data" section in the wrangle_act.ipynb.

Step 4: Storing Data
In the "Storing Data" section in the wrangle_act.ipynb notebook, store the cleaned master DataFrame in a CSV file with the main one named twitter_archive_master.csv. If additional files exist because multiple tables are required for tidiness, name these files appropriately. Additionally, you may store the cleaned data in a SQLite database (which is to be submitted as well if you do).

Step 5: Analyzing and Visualizing Data
In the Analyzing and Visualizing Data section in your wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, analyze and visualize your wrangled data.

You must produce at least three (3) insights and one (1) visualization.
You must clearly document the piece of assessed and cleaned (if necessary) data used to make each analysis and visualization.

Step 6: Reporting
Create a 300-600 word written report called wrangle_report.pdf or wrangle_report.html that briefly describes your wrangling efforts. This is to be framed as an internal document.

Create a 250-word-minimum written report called act_report.pdf or act_report.html that communicates all the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from your wrangled data. This is to be framed as an external document, like a blog post or magazine article, for example.
