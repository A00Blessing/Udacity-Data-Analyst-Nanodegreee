**Project: Wrangling and analyzing data**

+ **Step 1: Gathering Data**
In this step, you will gather all three pieces of data.

+ **Step 2: Assessing Data**
After gathering all three pieces of data, assess them visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues. Detect and document at least eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues.

+ **Step 3: Cleaning Data**
Clean all of the issues you documented while assessing. Perform this cleaning in the "Cleaning Data" section in the wrangle_act.ipynb.

+ **Step 4: Storing Data**
In the "Storing Data" section in the wrangle_act.ipynb notebook, store the cleaned master DataFrame in a CSV file with the main one named twitter_archive_master.csv.

+ **Step 5: Analyzing and Visualizing Data**
In the Analyzing and Visualizing Data section in your wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, analyze and visualize your wrangled data. You must produce at least three (3) insights and one (1) visualization. You must clearly document the piece of assessed and cleaned (if necessary) data used to make each analysis and visualization.
